## ü¶â Intro

DOM ([Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)) is an Application Programming Interface (API) which defines a HTML, XHTML or XML document as a tree structure where each node is an object representing a part of the document. The objects can be programatically manipulated via [DOM functions](https://www.impressivewebs.com/10-essential-dom-methods-techniques-for-practical-javascript/), and any changes after executing them will be visible in the document display.
