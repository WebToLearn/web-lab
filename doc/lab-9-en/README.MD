In the table below we can find the CRUD operations (_Create_, _Read_, _Update_ si _Delete_) associated with the appropiate HTTP methods:

| CRUD Operations | HTTP Methods | URL       | URL Parameters | Request body | Examples                 |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| _Create_       | POST        | /dogs     |                | body: {...}  | POST /dogs body: {...}   |
| _Read One_     | GET         | /dogs/:id | :id            |              | GET /dogs/123            |
| _Read All_     | GET         | /dogs     |                |              | GET /dogs                |
| _Update_       | PUT         | /dogs/:id | :id            | body: {...}  | PUT /dogs/123 body:{...} |
